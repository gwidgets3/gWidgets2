\arguments{
\item{items}{data.frame specifies items for selection. May be a vector, matrix or data frame}

\item{multiple}{logical allow  multiple selection}

\item{chosen.col}{which value from the row is returned by selection}

\item{icon.col}{NULL or integer. If latter, specifies column containing stock icon}

\item{tooltip.col}{NULL or integer. If latter, specifies column containing tooltip}

\item{handler}{A handler assigned to the default change
signal. Handlers are called when some event triggers a widget to
emit a signal. For each widget some default signal is assumed, and
handlers may be assigned to that through \code{addHandlerChanged}
or at construction time. Handlers are functions whose first
argument, \code{h} in the documentation, is a list with atleast
two components \code{obj}, referring to the object emitting the
signal and \code{action}, which passes in user-specified data to
parameterize the function call.

Handlers may also be added via \code{addHandlerXXX} methods for
the widgets, where \code{XXX} indicates the signal, with a default
signal mapped to \code{addHandlerChanged}
(cf. \code{\link{addHandler}} for a listing). These methods pass
back a handler ID that can be used with \code{blockHandler} and
\code{unblockHandler} to suppress temporarily the calling of the
handler.}

\item{action}{User supplied data passed to the handler when it is called}

\item{container}{A parent container. When a widget is created it can be
incorporated into the widget heirarchy by passing in a parent
container at construction time. (For some toolkits this is not
optional, e.g. \pkg{gWidgets2tcltk} or \pkg{gWidgets2WWW2}.)}

\item{...}{These values are passed to the \code{add} method of the
parent container. Examples of values are \code{expand},
\code{fill}, and \code{anchor}, although they're not always
supported by a given widget. For more details see \link{add}.
Occasionally the variable arguments feature has been used to sneak
in hidden arguments to toolkit implementations. For example, when
using a widget as a menubar object one can specify a parent
argument to pass in parent information, similar to how the
argument is used with gaction and the dialogs.}

\item{toolkit}{Each widget constructor is passed in the toolkit it
will use. This is typically done using the default, which will
lookup the toolkit through \code{\link{guiToolkit}}.}

\item{obj}{object of method call}

\item{index}{NULL or logical. If \code{TRUE} and widget supports it an index, instead of a value will be returned.}

\item{value}{value to assign for selection or property}

\item{x}{\code{GTable} object}

\item{i}{row index}

\item{j}{column index}

\item{drop}{do we drop when subsetting}
}
\value{
Returns an object of class \code{GTable}
}
\description{
The tabular widget allows a user to select one (or more) row(s)
using the mouse or keyboard selection. The selected rows are the
main property and are returned by svalue through their key (from
the column specified by \code{chosen.col}), or by index. The
change handler changes on double-click event. Use add handler
click to respond to a change in selection.

For gtable one can pass in row(s) to select by index (when index=TRUE) or by match among the values in the chosen column.
For setting by index, a value of 0L or integer(0) will clear the current selection

For \code{GTable} objects the \code{[} and \code{[<-} methods are
(mostly) implemented. The \code{[} method allows one to access the
object using the regular matrix notation (but there is no list
notation, e.g. \code{$} or \code{[[}, defined). The \code{[<-}
method is available, but for most toolkits is restricted: one can
not add columns, add rows, remove columns, remove rows, or change
the type of the column. For all of these actions, one can reassign
the items being displayed through the idiom \code{obj[] <-
new_items}. This allows the widget to resize or redo the column
renderers.

The change handler for \code{GTable} is called when the selection
changes. This is often the result of a click event (but need not
be), although we alias to \code{addHandlerClicked}. For double
click events, see \code{addHandlerDoubleclick}.

Double clicking is used to activate an item (single click is
selection). We also bind pressing the Return key on an item to
initiate this signal

For \code{GTable}, visibility refers to which rows are currently
shown, not whether the widget itself is shown or hidden. (For the
latter, place the widget into a container and adjust that). One
can use this method to perform filtering by adjusting which rows
are displayed according to some criteria that returns a logical.

For \code{GTable} the \code{size<-}  method is overridden to allow
one to specify the column widths. To do so, pass in the values for
\code{width}, \code{height} or \code{column.widths} as named components
of a list. The value of \code{column.widths} should be a numeric
vector of pixel widths of length matching the number of columns.

\details{
Many generic methods for data frames are implemented for
\code{gtable}. These include \code{[}, \code{[<-}, \code{length},
\code{names}, and \code{names<-}
