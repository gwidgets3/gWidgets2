\arguments{
\item{text}{initial text}

\item{type}{type of browser: to open a file, to save a file or to select a directory}

\item{initial.filename}{Suggested file name}

\item{initial.dir}{initial directory. If a filename is given, and is not an absolute name, this will be prepended. If filename given initial directory will be taken from that.}

\item{filter}{A filter specifiation. This can be a named character vector of file extensions or something toolkit specific.
Here are some examples:
\itemize{
\item{character}{c("csv"="csv","txt"="txt")}
\item{RGtk2}{ Something like
  \preformatted{
list("All files" = list(patterns = c("*")),
     "R files" = list(patterns = c("*.R", "*.Rdata")),
     "text files" = list(mime.types = c("text/plain"))
    )
  }
}
\item{tcltk}{}
\item{Qt}{}
}}

\item{multi}{Logical. Allow multiple files to be selected?}

\item{...}{These values are passed to the \code{add} method of the
parent container. Examples of values are \code{expand},
\code{fill}, and \code{anchor}, although they're not always
supported by a given widget. For more details see \link{add}.
Occasionally the variable arguments feature has been used to sneak
in hidden arguments to toolkit implementations. For example, when
using a widget as a menubar object one can specify a parent
argument to pass in parent information, similar to how the
argument is used with gaction and the dialogs.}

\item{toolkit}{Each widget constructor is passed in the toolkit it
will use. This is typically done using the default, which will
lookup the toolkit through \code{\link{guiToolkit}}.}

\item{quote}{quote output}

\item{handler}{A handler assigned to the default change
signal. Handlers are called when some event triggers a widget to
emit a signal. For each widget some default signal is assumed, and
handlers may be assigned to that through \code{addHandlerChanged}
or at construction time. Handlers are functions whose first
argument, \code{h} in the documentation, is a list with atleast
two components \code{obj}, referring to the object emitting the
signal and \code{action}, which passes in user-specified data to
parameterize the function call.

Handlers may also be added via \code{addHandlerXXX} methods for
the widgets, where \code{XXX} indicates the signal, with a default
signal mapped to \code{addHandlerChanged}
(cf. \code{\link{addHandler}} for a listing). These methods pass
back a handler ID that can be used with \code{blockHandler} and
\code{unblockHandler} to suppress temporarily the calling of the
handler.}

\item{action}{User supplied data passed to the handler when it is called}

\item{container}{A parent container. When a widget is created it can be
incorporated into the widget heirarchy by passing in a parent
container at construction time. (For some toolkits this is not
optional, e.g. \pkg{gWidgets2tcltk} or \pkg{gWidgets2WWW2}.)}
}
\value{
returns filename(s) or \code{character(0)} if no selection.

Returns an object of class \code{gFilebrowse}. This should
inherit the methods  of \code{gedit} instances.
}
\description{
Basically an entry box instance with a button to initiate \code{gfile}.
