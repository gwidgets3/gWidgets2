}
\arguments{
\item{title}{title for window's title bar. This is the main
property and is accessed via \code{svalue} or \code{svalue<-}.}

\item{visible}{logical. If code{TRUE} window is drawn when
constructed. Otherwise, window can be drawn later using
\code{visible<-}. This value can default to \code{FALSE} by
setting the option:
\code{options("gWidgets:gwindow-default-visible-is-false"=TRUE)}.
There are advantages: windows can draw slowly when adding many
items. With \pkg{gWidgets2RGtk2}, the  \code{ggraphics} widget can
like to be added to an undrawn widget as this avoids sizing issue.}

\item{name}{Name for registry of windows}

\item{width}{initial width of window}

\item{height}{initial height of window. This sets height before window manager manages the window}

\item{parent}{If non-NULL, can be used to suggest default location
of window. The argument name was changed from location to
parent. This can be a coordinate pair (x,y) with (0,0) the upper
left corner, or a gwindow instance. In the latter case the
location is suggested by the location of the current window. This
is useful for placing dialogs near the parent window.}

\item{handler}{handler for destroy event}

\item{action}{action passed t handler}

\item{...}{ignored}

\item{toolkit}{toolkit}

\item{obj}{parent object}

\item{child}{child widget}

\item{expand}{NULL or logical. For box containers controls whether a child will expand to fill the allocated space.}

\item{fill}{NULL or character. For box containers. The value of \code{fill} (not
always respected) is used to control if expansion happens
vertically (\code{y}), horizontally (\code{x}) or both
(\code{both} or \code{TRUE}). For vertically filled box
containers, children always fill horizontally (atleast) and for
horizontally filled box containers, children always fill
vertically (atleast). This is important to realize when trying to
size buttons, say.}

\item{anchor}{NULL or integer. For box containers. The anchor argument is used to
position the child within the parent when there is more space
allocated than the child requests. This is specified with a
Cartesian pair in {-1,0,1} x {-1, 0, 1}.}

\description{
top-level window object

Dispatches on type of child (menubar, toolbar, statusbar, widget)

The \code{dispose} method destroys the top-level window and its children.
