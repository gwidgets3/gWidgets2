\title{constructor for a two-paned container}
\usage{
gpanedgroup(horizontal = TRUE, container = NULL, ..., toolkit = guiToolkit())

.gpanedgroup(toolkit, horizontal = TRUE, container = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{horizontal}{direction of layout}

\item{container}{A parent container. When a widget is created it can be
incorporated into the widget heirarchy by passing in a parent
container at construction time. (For some toolkits this is not
optional, e.g. \pkg{gWidgets2tcltk} or \pkg{gWidgets2WWW2}.)}

\item{...}{These values are passed to the \code{add} method of the
parent container. Examples of values are \code{expand},
\code{fill}, and \code{anchor}, although they're not always
supported by a given widget. For more details see \link{add}.
Occasionally the variable arguments feature has been used to sneak
in hidden arguments to toolkit implementations. For example, when
using a widget as a menubar object one can specify a parent
argument to pass in parent information, similar to how the
argument is used with gaction and the dialogs.}

\item{toolkit}{Each widget constructor is passed in the toolkit it
will use. This is typically done using the default, which will
lookup the toolkit through \code{\link{guiToolkit}}.}
}
\description{
A container for holding two child widgets where the space
allocated to each can be manipulated by the user with a pane
between the widgets, or programatticaly via \code{svalue<-}.  The
value specified to \code{svalue<-} can be a number in $[0,1]$, in
which case it is a proportion or an integer, in which case it is a
pixel size (from the left or the top). The ambiguous case \code{1}
or \code{1L} is determined by class. The value of \code{svalue} is in proportion units.
}
\details{
Child widgets are added in the usual way, typically through the
\code{container} argument of a constructor. Only two children may
be added. Children expand and fill the allocated space.
}
\note{
Setting the size is often only possible after the container
has been realized on the screen. In the example, this call of
\code{svalue<-} is done after the parent window is made visible
for this reason. There were arguments to specify the children at
construction, but these have been removed.

w <- gwindow("gpanedgroup", visible=FALSE)
pg <- gpanedgroup(cont=w)

svalue(pg) <- 0.33
