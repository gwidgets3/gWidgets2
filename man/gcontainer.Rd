\usage{
gcontainer(container = NULL, ..., toolkit = guiToolkit())
}
\arguments{
\item{container}{A parent container. When a widget is created it can be
incorporated into the widget heirarchy by passing in a parent
container at construction time. (For some toolkits this is not
optional, e.g. \pkg{gWidgets2tcltk} or \pkg{gWidgets2WWW2}.)}

\item{...}{These values are passed to the \code{add} method of the
parent container, and occasionally have been used to sneak in
hidden arguments to toolkit implementations.}

\item{toolkit}{Each widget constructor is passed in the toolkit it
will use. This is typically done using the default, which will
lookup the toolkit through \code{\link{guiToolkit}}.}
